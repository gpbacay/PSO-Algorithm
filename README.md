# PSO-Algorithm
This repository implements a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize point positions in a 2D space. It generates random target and obstacle locations and visualizes the optimization process using matplotlib. This project serves as a demonstration of PSO in solving optimization problems.
